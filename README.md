# Snooker Ball Tracking - ` snookerCV `

## Overview
This project is a **computer vision-based solution** designed to track snooker balls in a video using **a custom-trained YOLOv11 model and OpenCV**. The system accurately detects, labels, and tracks snooker balls, assigning unique IDs and drawing trails to visualize movement. Additionally, it allows for tracking only specific colored balls using **color segmentation**, ensuring precise ball identification.

### **Key Features**
âœ… **Custom-labeled dataset** for improved accuracy (Roboflow).  
âœ… **Custom-trained YOLOv11 model** for snooker ball detection.  
âœ… Detects and labels snooker balls with bounding boxes.  
âœ… Assigns unique IDs to each ball for tracking.  
âœ… Draws movement trails to show the ball's path.   
âœ… Implements **color segmentation** for precise tracking.
âœ… Filters and tracks only selected colored balls. 
âœ… Supports recorded video processing.

## Installation
### 1. Install Python
Ensure you have Python **3.8 or later** installed. Download it here:  
ðŸ”— [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snookerCV.git
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all required packages, including:
- `ultralytics` (for YOLOv11)
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`

## Model & Data Setup
### **1. YOLOv11 Model**
The trained YOLOv11 model (`v4_snookerCV.pt`) is already included in the repository under the `model/` folder. No extra downloads are required.
- `model/v4_snookerCV.pt`

### **2. Sample Test Data (Videos & Images)**
Sample test videos are included in the repository in the `videos/` folder:
- `videos/sample1.mp4`
- `videos/sample2.mp4`
- `videos/sample3.mp4`

You can use these videos for testing or provide your own video files.

## Run Code
This project includes **two separate scripts**:
1. `app.py` â€“ Tracks **all balls** in the video (normal detection & tracking)
2. `color_tracker.py` â€“ Tracks **only a selected ball color** (color-based tracking)

### **1. Run Normal Snooker Ball Tracking (All Balls)**
This script detects, labels, and tracks **all balls** with unique IDs and movement trails.
```bash
python3 app.py {video sample path}
```
*Ex:*\
Use `python` (windows) and `python3` (mac)
```bash
python3 app.py videos/sample1.mp4
``` 
or
```bash
python3 app.py videos/sample2.mp4
```


### **2. Run Color-Specific Snooker Ball Tracking**
This script detects and tracks **only the selected color ball**.
```bash
python3 color_tracker.py {color}
```
*Ex:*\
Use `python` (windows) and `python3` (mac)
```bash
python3 color_tracker.py red
```
Select a color from: `red, orange, yellow, green, blue, black`

## Demonstration Videos
Videos demonstrating both methods will be added in the README:

ðŸ“Œ **Color-Based Ball Tracking** (color_tracker.py) â€“ *[Video Link]()*

## Custom Dataset & Licensing
This project includes a **custom dataset** labelled on **[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)** for improved model accuracy. The dataset was manually labeled for snooker ball detection and classification.
- **Dataset License:** The custom dataset is licensed for open use with attribution. (CC by 4.0)
- **Roboflow Dataset Link:** ðŸ”— [Custom Labelled Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/any-doggo/snookerballv3/dataset/6)  

The dataset was used to train a YOLOv11 model specifically for detecting and tracking snooker balls.
